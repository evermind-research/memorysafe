# MemorySafe – Taste Demo v2

This demo illustrates a memory governance system:

- Predicts forgetting risk (MVI)
- Protects fragile but valuable memories
- Actively forgets noisy or low-value ones
- Prioritizes replay based on vulnerability

This is not an accuracy benchmark.
This is a behavioral demonstration of memory governance.
