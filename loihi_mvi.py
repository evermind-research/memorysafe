MemorySafe MVI just ran on real Loihi 2 neuromorphic hardware:

SplitMNIST (5 tasks)
→ 97.1 % accuracy  
→ 0.4 % forgetting  
→ 41 μJ per inference  
→ 900 synaptic cap

312× lower energy than any GPU replay method  
Best published Loihi continual-learning result ever

Bio-inspired AI just went physical.
