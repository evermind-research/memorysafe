MemorySafe is a memory governance framework for continual learning systems, designed to prevent safety-critical information from being forgotten under memory and compute constraints.

Rather than modifying how models learn, MemorySafe governs **what they retain**.

It operates as a policy-level decision layer for memory, acting as an intelligent governor that disciplines data retention independently of the learning algorithm.

Use cases include medical AI, edge systems, fraud detection, robotics, and privacy-aware AI.

## Problem

Modern continual learning systems implicitly conflate **exposure with importance**.

Under standard replay strategies:
- frequent samples dominate memory,
- rare but critical events are overwritten,
- long-term reliability degrades.

This is especially harmful in:
- medical AI,
- edge systems,
- fraud detection,
- safety-critical robotics.

MemorySafe reframes memory as a **resource allocation and lifecycle management problem**, explicitly separating:

> **Risk ≠ Value ≠ Decision**

## Core Concepts

### 1. Memory Vulnerability Index (MVI)
MVI estimates how likely a memory is to be forgotten under future learning pressure.

It captures:
- interference from new tasks,
- sensitivity to gradient updates,
- temporal competition effects.

MVI is:
- predictive (not retrospective),
- continuous and interpretable,
- model-agnostic.

### 2. Memory Relevance (Value)
Relevance estimates how valuable a memory is, independently of its vulnerability.

Guiding principles:
- repetition ≠ importance,
- rare but salient events retain value,
- relevance decays over time.

### 3. ProtectScore (Decision Signal)
ProtectScore combines MVI and Relevance into a deterministic decision signal that governs:
- protection,
- consolidation,
- eviction under fixed capacity.

This treats forgetting as an **active, functional choice**, not a system failure.

## What MemorySafe Is (and Is Not)

**MemorySafe is:**
- a memory governance layer,
- compatible with any learning algorithm,
- model-agnostic and pluggable,
- interpretable and low-overhead.

**MemorySafe is not:**
- a replacement for training,
- a full continual learning algorithm,
- a benchmark-optimized model.

It governs **memory decisions**, not learning dynamics.

---

## Architecture

MemorySafe acts as a policy layer on top of replay buffers or memory modules.

It maintains per-memory attributes:
- task_id  
- MVI  
- relevance  
- protect_score  
- replay_count  
- protected flag  

Guarantees:
- no gradients inside memory logic,
- no dataset-specific heuristics,
- deterministic and auditable behavior.

---

## Generalization & Validation

The same unchanged MemorySafe policy was evaluated across heterogeneous continual learning benchmarks:

- MNIST  
- Fashion-MNIST  
- CIFAR-10  
- CIFAR-100  
- Omniglot  
- Permuted MNIST  
- PneumoniaMNIST (medical imaging)

Without dataset-specific tuning, MemorySafe demonstrated:
- consistent Task-0 protection,
- strong rare-event retention,
- stability across increasing task difficulty.

These results indicate **zero-shot generalization of a memory allocation policy**.

## Use Cases

- **Medical AI**  
  Protection of rare pathologies and safety-critical cases.

- **Edge AI (Jetson / embedded)**  
  Memory governance under tight RAM and compute budgets.

- **Fraud Detection**  
  Retention of delayed or rare anomalies.

- **Robotics**  
  Preservation of critical failures and safety events.

- **Privacy-Aware AI**  
  Predictive forgetting and sensitive data governance (MVI-P).

## Integration

MemorySafe is compatible with:

- Experience Replay  
- GEM / A-GEM  
- PackNet  
- Progressive Neural Networks  
- Custom replay buffers  

It can be integrated as:
- a replay gate,
- an eviction governor,
- a diagnostic layer for memory risk.

## Technology Stack

- PyTorch  
- CUDA / GPU accelerated training  
- Designed for integration with modern ML pipelines  
- Research prototype (Alpha)

## One-Sentence Essence

**MemorySafe treats AI memory as a governed resource, separating vulnerability from value to enable intentional, interpretable, and generalizable memory decisions under real-world constraints.**
